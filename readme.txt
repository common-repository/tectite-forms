Install a secure anti-spam form.  Use our sample forms or easily design your own form.

== Description ==

Create a professional and secure web form quickly and easily without scripting, HTML or coding of any type, completely free.

Our online form designer creates your form (or use a sample to get started) and you simply copy-and-paste
your unique form code to your WordPress blog or page.

Simply install the Tectite Forms plugin into WordPress, create your account on our Hosted Forms service, and you'll have
a working contact form (or other form) operating perfectly in minutes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `tectite-forms` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Create your account at [Tectite Hosted Forms](https://www.tectite.com/hf/auth/GetStarted).
4. Design your form (or use one of our samples).
5. Copy-and-paste your unique Form Code to your WordPress blog or page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are Hosted Forms? =

Your form appears on your WordPress site, but we host the form processing for you.
We support Ajax forms, so your website *visitors never leave your website*.

= Why use Hosted Forms? =

* **Reliability**.  We all know email can be unreliable.  We record form submissions so you
can check that you haven't lost a contact. Plus, we send you a daily report so you
can reconcile the emails you've received with the count shown.
These features are critical if your website visitors are important to you.
* **Security**.  Historically, many PHP mail scripts have been notoriously insecure.
By using our server for form processing your server cannot be compromised by a faulty
mail script you might install.
* **Anti-spam**. We have over 10 years experience (since 2002) in anti-spam technology for form processing - without
requiring the CAPTCHA that your visitors probably dislike.  Also, by analyzing spam information from many Hosted
Form users, we're always improving the technology to minimize any form spam.
